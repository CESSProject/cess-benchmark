# CESS DeOSS Performance Test on CESS Testnet v0.7.6

This document presents the results of a performance test conducted on CESS DeOSS using the CESS Testnet v0.7.6. The objective was to evaluate upload, download, and miner distribution times under different conditions.

## Test Setup & Methodology

### Test Environment

We conducted the test under two different settings:

1. **Both Servers in Singapore**

   - DeOSS Gateway Location: Singapore
   - Test System Location: Singapore
   - Expected minimal network latency due to proximity.
   - Distributed Setup (Server in India & DeOSS in Singapore)

2. **DeOSS Gateway Location: Singapore**
   - Test System Location: India
   - Introduced additional latency to measure real-world performance impact.

### Test Procedure

- **Tested three different file sizes**: 1MB, 8MB, and 64MB.
- **Each test was run for 10 iterations****, and we took the **average result** for accuracy.
- **Measured metrics**:
  - **Upload Time** (Time taken to upload the file to DeOSS).
  - **Download Time** (Time taken to retrieve the file from DeOSS).
  - **Distribution Time** (Time taken for the file to be distributed to CESS miners).
- **Source Code for the Test**: Available on GitHub: [ðŸ”— CESS SDK Test Repository](https://github.com/tehsunnliu/cess_sdk_test)

## Test Results

### Singapore-Singapore Setup

| File Size (MB) | Avg. Upload Time Avg. | Download Time Avg. | Distribution to Miners |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1MB | 4.1s | 46ms | ~4m 11s |
| 8MB | 5.0s | 2.77s | ~4m 29s |
| 64MB | 10.3s | 33.22s | ~8m 25s |

### Singapore-India Setup

| File Size (MB) | Avg. Upload Time Avg. | Download Time Avg. | Distribution to Miners |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
|1MB | 4.8s | 2.12ms | ~4m 21s |
|8MB | 5.136s | 2.77s | ~4m 34s |
|64MB | 11.24s | 33.22s | ~10m 2s |

## Observations & Insights

- **Download speeds remained fast** across both setups, even with latency differences.
- **Upload time increased slightly** when the test system was in India, likely due to network latency.
- **Miner distribution time scaled proportionally** with file size but was not significantly affected by location differences.

## Conclusion

The test validates that CESS DeOSS provides efficient, low-latency decentralized storage, even when accessing it from different geographical locations. The results demonstrate CESS's strong performance in upload, download, and distribution across varying network conditions.
